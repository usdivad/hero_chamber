David's Live Performance Setups
===============================

Various electronic setups for live performances as well as tools such as VST/AU plugins. Includes WIP experiments and some workflow notes.

Mostly in C++, Pd (Pure Data), ChucK, Ableton Live, and SPEAR.

Aside from experiments, these will mostly be cloned/copied from other repositories or sandboxes as an archive of those setups.
