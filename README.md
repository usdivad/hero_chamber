David's Live Performance Setups
===============================

Various electronic setups for live performances. Includes WIP experiments and some workflow notes.

Mostly in Pd (Pure Data), ChucK, Ableton Live, and SPEAR.

Aside from experiments, these will mostly be cloned/copied from other repositories or sandboxes as an archive of those setups.
